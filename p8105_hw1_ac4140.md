Question 1
==========

\#\#Created a data frame **a random sample of size 8 from a standard normal distrubution ** a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample greater than 0 \*\* a character vector of length of 8 \*\* a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor "levels" \*\*converted variables as numeric functions for the logical, character and vector varaibles

``` r
set.seed (10)

hw1_df = tibble (
  norm_samp = rnorm (8),
  norm_samp_pos = (norm_samp > 0),
  vec_char = c("My", "name", "is",   "Arielle","this", "is", "homework", "one"),
  size_factor = factor (c("small", "small",  "small", "medium",  "medium", "medium", "large", "large"))
                        
)

mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.3779272

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_pos))
```

    ## [1] 0.375

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, size_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, size_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

\#\#The code gave a mean for norm\_samp and norm\_samp\_pos because they are numerical values. This does not work for vec\_char and size\_factor because they are charactor and factor vectors.

\#\# Created a new code chunk that found the mean of the numeric values for logical, character, and factor varaibles

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_pos)))
```

    ## [1] 0.375

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_char)))
```

    ## Warning in mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_char))): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, size_factor)))
```

    ## [1] 2.125

\#\#The code for norm\_samp\_poss gives a value of 0.625 this is because the the logical varaible was able to be converted to a numeric one because the logical variables can be converted to 0 and 1. The code for vec\_char has NA because there is no numerical variable for this variable. The code for size\_factor gave a mean however there were NA produced.

\#\# convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result \#\# convert the logical vector to a factor, and multiply the random sample by the result
\#\#convert the logical vector to a factor and then convert the result to numeric, and multiply the random sample by the result

``` r
(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp_pos)))*(pull(hw1_df, norm_samp))
```

Question 2
==========

\#\# Created a new data frame that comprised of x: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution y: a random sample of size 500 from a standard Normal distribution A logical vector indicating whether x + y &gt; 1 A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector A factor vector created by coercing the above logical vector

``` r
set.seed (1234)

hw1_df2 = tibble (
  x = rnorm(500),
  y = rnorm(500),
  a = (x + y > 1)
)
  b = as.numeric(pull(hw1_df2, a))
  c = as.factor(pull(hw1_df2, a))
```

The data set `hw1_df2` has 500, and ncol 3 *The mean for x is 0.0018388, *The median for x is -0.0207073, *The standard deviation for x is 1.0348139 *The proportion of cases for which x + y &gt; 1 is 0.232

\#\# Made a scatterplot of y vs x; color points using the logical variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help). Make a second and third scatterplot that color points using the numeric and factor variables, respectively, and comment on the color scales.

``` r
ggplot (hw1_df2, aes(x = x, y = y,  color = a)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
## In the first scatter plot it shows y vs x, the blue represent the values of x + y that are greater than 1. The pink represenst the values of x + y that are less than 1. 

ggplot (hw1_df2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = b)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
## In the second scatter plot it shows y vs x, the light blue are the values of x +y greater than 1 and the the black represents the values that x +y is less than 1. This graph is on a scale base and it shows the two extremes of 1 and 0.

ggplot (hw1_df2, aes(x = x, y = y, color = c)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
## In the third scatter plot it shows y vs x, the blue represent the values of x + y that are greater than 1. The pink represenst the values of x + y that are less than 1.The first and the third graphs show up as the same.  

ggplot (hw1_df2, aes(x = x, y = y,  color = a)) + geom_point()
